# utility

A PHP utility project for exception classes and wrapper functions

These utility classes exist because basic PHP functions return a mix of false or
null on failure rather than throwing exceptions which is tedious to deal with.
If a signal value is returned, return null rather than false.

## Setup

See [Project Setup Guide](docs/setup_guide.md).
